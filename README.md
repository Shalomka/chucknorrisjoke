These are my experiments with the Riverpod state management
for Flutter and Chuck Norris Jokes archive.

Riverpod seems to be more fun to work with, required less boilerplate and
separates buisness logic better than other solutions. However, it is still
very young and I would not recommend using it for the production.

Besides, with the insane choice of different providers, suited for particular
tasks and behaving diferrently I found refactoring somehow challenging.

Said that, the team behind Riverpod is enormously productive and I expect
much improved versions 2 and even 3 to be released soon. Untill then I move back
to tryed and tested Provider.
